# Dork Tool

Dork Tool is a Python script that allows you to perform Google dorking, which is a method of using advanced search operators to find specific information on the web using the Google search engine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/xyz/dork.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```shell
   cd dork
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python dork.py -d <search_query>
   ```

Replace `<search_query>` with your desired search query. Enclose the query in quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.

2. The script will retrieve the search results from Google and extract the URLs matching the search query.

3. The extracted URLs will be printed to the console.

## Note: VPN Usage

If you encounter rate limits or IP address blocking from Google during usage, it is recommended to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) service. A VPN can help you mask your IP address and bypass any restrictions set by Google.

Ensure that you have a reliable VPN service installed and running before using the Dork Tool. This will help you avoid any potential limitations and ensure smooth execution.
